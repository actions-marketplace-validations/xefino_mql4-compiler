# mql4-compiler
I created this GitHub action because, after attempting to use the [MQL-Compiler-Action](https://github.com/FX31337/MQL-Compile-Action) from FX31337, I found that there was no combination of parameters that would allow me to actually compile my MQL4 files. Therefore, I have created this action to allow users to compile their .mq4 files on GitHub.
